8. Some unknown things:
1) watermarks, checkpoints (both clique and pbft have it)
2) Cert and CertStore do not contain any certs.
3) timer mechanisms---broadcast timer, viewchange timer, softstartTimer, startTimer etc.

7. in pbft-core.go add ProtocolManager, but vscode cannot find its definition. Method to resolve it:
"~/go/bin/godef -debug -f pbft-core.go eth.ProtocolManager"

find which package is not installed, then install it using goget:
"go get gopkg.in/fatih/set.v0"

6. timer mechanism:
   timer is created by timerFactory, and it is associated with the Manager of obcBatch,
so from obcBatch, one can control all timers.

5. we do not need batch, because we process candidate block with PBFT algorithm
each node sign the block with its key, just like Clique?

4. checkpoint, state related codes should be commented all

1. in ethereum, no need to execute txs or contracts
   A candidate block is Finalized and then mined, then is inserted to the blockchain;
   InsertChain -> State_Processor.Process() -> ApplyMessage(), update state root etc.
2. in pbft, each transaction/contract is executed after consensus (need to call chaincode.ApplyTransaction)
   No need to execute/rollback etc. anymore.

3. delete 1 line in pbft-core.go, want to check which parts need for logging
